Call SNP
>>>>>Target
The aim of this project is to analyse the heterozygosity and similarity of 1255, 1452, 198, 1746.


>>>>>Structure of the Source
0. Build index files
1. Maping,sort,rmove duplicate,build index after remove duplicate,call mutution
2. Combine gvcf,convert to vcf,export SNP as a table file
3. Calculate heterozygosity and similarity


>>>>>Path of relational file
Software:
bwa, Samtools, GATK, R
